# RISC_ISA_Pipeline

Assembler.c takes an assembly code file via command-line input and outputs the corresponding machine code file. Simulator.c simulates the behavior of a pipelined processor based on the machine code file given as input. The processor in this project is a simplified version of an ARM processor with a smaller subset of instructions and 8 registers instead of 32.
